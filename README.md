# Cloud Network Performance Monitoring System

This project monitors network performance, server health, packet latency, and uptime to ensure
high availability and smooth customer experience in cloud environments.

## ✅ Objective
Detect service degradation early and trigger alerts before customers are impacted.

## 🛰 Features
✅ Real-time Server Health Monitoring  
✅ Packet Loss & Latency Tracking  
✅ Alert Trigger System (Email/Log Alerts)  
✅ Linux Networking Tools Integration  
✅ Scalable Cloud Deployment Support

## 🧪 Network Tools Used
ping → connectivity & latency check
traceroute → routing path analysis
tcpdump → packet capture & analysis
netstat → network statistics and active connections

## 🔧 Technologies Used
- Java
- Linux Network Stack
- Shell Scripting (Basic)
- SQL (Optional for logging history)

## 📈 Output Analytics
